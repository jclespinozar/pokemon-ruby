This project consists to build a very close recreation of the classic Pokemon
game. You will be able to select one pokemon at the beginning of the game. Then
you can train your pokemon in a battle with other random trainers. You will be
able to see your pokemon stats to check your progress. When you feel ready, you
will be able to challenge Gym Leader Brock. If you defeat Brock you won the game
üí™üèº.
